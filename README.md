Chemical Engineering final year project simulating a copper solvent extraction process with valve faults using PCA and statistical classification to identify when the process enters a fault state.

The process model consists of a dynamic model of a copper solvent extraction plant based on the model developed by Komulainen et al. (2009, 2006). 
The model simulates two control valve faults, namely:

- stuck valves
- and valve stiction, based on the physical valve stiction model developed by Shoukat Choudhury et al. (2005)
